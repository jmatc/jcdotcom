# jacket

#### Note:

If you intend on publishing this module to NPM, be sure to update your package.json file from 'jacket', to your own module. It may also be a good idea to define your own dependencies, and rename the contents of your package file anyway. The jacket package.json file is only here to get you started and allow publishing to NPM.

### Prep work

Update your config ` ./jacket-config.json ` by adding the naem of your app. When the build process is executed, grunt will read from this file and generate the necessary files needed for your AMD architecture.

### Build it

```bash
$ grunt
```

### Open it up in your browser

```
localhost:6789
```
